# Event Management System

## Description
This project is a multi-threaded Event Management System featuring a robust client-server architecture. It excels at efficiently handling events and solving challenges related to the producer-consumer problem. 
The Event Manager receives input via `.jobs` files located inside the `jobs` directory. After executing the commands specified in the `.jobs` file, the program creates a corresponding `.out` file in the same directory containing the output.
