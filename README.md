# Event Management System

## Description
This project is a multi-threaded Event Management System featuring a robust client-server architecture. It excels at efficiently handling events and solving challenges related to the producer-consumer problem. 
The Event Manager receives input via `.jobs` files located inside the `jobs` directory. After executing the commands specified in the `.jobs` file, the program creates a corresponding `.out` file in the same directory containing the output.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the Event Manager up and running on your machine:

### Installation:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-manager.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd event-manager`
3. [Install dependencies](#dependencies): Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
4. [Build the project](#build): Compile the source code to create the executable.

## Usage

Explore the features of the Event Manager to efficiently manage events using its multi-threaded capabilities and client-server architecture.

1. Place your `.jobs` files inside the `jobs` directory.
2. Execute the program to process the events and generate corresponding `.out` files.
